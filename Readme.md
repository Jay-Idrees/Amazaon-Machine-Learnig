- **Artificial Intelligence**- Software developement to perform activities with human like intelligence by using examples from real-world data
- **Machine learnig** is a type of artificial intelligence
    - `Supervised learning` - The training sample has lables, the algoritm learns to predict lablesthe labels are the outcome variables. examples: predicting housing prices, identifying objects in image. For instance you can use a training model where you train the ML model with a given set of flowers and their corresponding names. Then once the model is trained the 
    - `Unsupervised learning` - No lables, but the algorithm tries to identify ptterns in data

    - Labeled data is is the data that already contains the solutions- thats when you use a supervised model. The outcome is already defined

- In Supervised and Unsupervised learning, models inspect data to discover patterns

    - `Re-inforcment leraning` - The algorithm is programed and then takes actions to maximize a reward - Learns through conseques to actions e-g like traning pets- you give rewards for correct outcome

## Components of Machine Learning

- **Machine learning Model** - Starting/generic model code e-g linear regression- It is the raw form of the model before training
- **Model training algorithm** - Inspect the data and compares results against the final product, makes changes to the model to reach closer to the product, then repeat untill the final product is achieved. In other words it is an iterative process fitting a model to specific data
- **Model inference algorithm** - No you apply the trained model on a new dataset - Now this trained model is used to make predictions. In other words you use a trained model to solve a task

- Below are the `five` steps of machine learning. All these steps are iterative at each stage.

- **Define the problem** 
    - This is when you make the decision about whether you are going to use supervised learning or unsupervised learning,
    - Whether you will use a categorical outcome (binary such as mortality) or a continues/regression outcome (numerical/such as cost) for supervised learning or clustering in unsupervised learning
    - The unsupervised learning includes clustering and deep learning

- **Build Dataset**
- **Train Model**
- **Evaluate Model**
- **Use Model/Inference**
